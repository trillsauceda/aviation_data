			<p><strong>How is air travel safer than car travel?</strong><br>Data taken in the last 15 years has shown that traveling by air is much safer and much more cost-effective than getting to the same destination via car or other modes of transport.</p>

			<p>Between 1994 and 2009, the average number of fatalities in total from aircraft crashes is 20.106 people.<br>

			<br>This compared to data for passenger cars in the same time frame is significantly less than the average number of fatal car crashes which sits at a steep 26,331 people. This means that you are much more likely to die in a car crash than in an airplane.<br>

			<br>Thanks to strict regulation and safety measures, aircraft are designed, manufactured and operated with the safety of the passengers in mind.<br>

			<br>Between 2006 and 2016 alone, there have been 6,434 air traffic fatalities worldwide, with 2015 being the safest having 185 recorded fatalities <strong>WORLDWIDE</strong>.
